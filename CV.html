                    At university, I benefited from formal education. I was more inclined towards programming topics. I also
            carried out many extracurricular activities and was responsible for one of the academic committees in
            the department. I worked to organize activities and review lectures, and workshops in coordination with
            experts from outside the university, and I believe that my university experience was beneficial on both the
            methodological and extracurricular levels.
