    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>

            <li>
                At university, I benefited from formal education. I was more inclined towards programming topics. I also
        carried out many extracurricular activities and was responsible for one of the academic committees in
        the department. I worked to organize activities and review lectures, and workshops in coordination with
        experts from outside the university, and I believe that my university experience was beneficial on both the
        methodological and extracurricular levels.
